# pytorch_linear_nonlinear_cnn
pytorch_linear_nonlinear_cnn
This code does the following:

Imports: It imports necessary libraries such as PyTorch, torchvision, matplotlib, and helper functions.
Dataset Preparation: Downloads and prepares the FashionMNIST dataset for training and testing.
Data Exploration: It checks the dataset's size and classes and visualizes sample images.
Data Loading: Creates dataloaders for both training and test datasets.
Model Definition (Model 0): Defines a simple feedforward neural network model.
Model Training (Model 0): Trains the model on the training dataset.
Model Evaluation (Model 0): Evaluates the trained model on the test dataset.
Model Definition (Model 1): Defines a more complex neural network model with non-linear activation functions.
Model Training (Model 1): Trains the second model on the training dataset.
Model Evaluation (Model 1): Evaluates the trained model on the test dataset.

The code compares the performance of two models on the FashionMNIST dataset. Model 0 is a simple feedforward neural network, while Model 1 includes non-linear activation functions. The code then prints out the test loss and accuracy for both models.
